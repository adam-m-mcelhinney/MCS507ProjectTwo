\section{Conclusion} % (fold)
We have shown how the Earth software package implements the MARS algorithm and how it can be very useful for quickly solving real world problems. We demonstrated how it easily beats least squares regression, while requiring less work from the actual modeler. However, this is by no means a definitive answer. Some factors beyond the scope of this assignment, but relevant for future inquiry are:
\begin{enumerate}
\item Execution time (particularly on large data sets)
\item High dimensional data (data sets where there are a much larger amount of explanatory variables as compared with the number of observations)
\item Various variable transformations and their ability to improve the quality of the OLS models
\item Calculating statistical significance and variance with the MARS model
\item Available heuristics to improve MARS calculation time, including the Fast Mars model (Friedman 1993, p. 1-19)
\item Utilizing MARS for purposes of classification 
\item Implementing our own MARS algorithm and comparing performance to that of the Earth software
\end{enumerate}

In summation, the Earth software package is a cross-platform, versatile tool with applications to real world data sets. It should be considered by any modeler seeking a fast, intuitive and accurate regression modeling technique.
